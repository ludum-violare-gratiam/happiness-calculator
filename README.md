# Happiness Calculator
## How this works
The happiness calculator works by measuring your happiness utilizing the Happiness Index, then finding the first and second derivatives to accurately predict your future happiness. This is not a working calculator, where you input data, merely a data analysis that you can download and input data locally over time.
